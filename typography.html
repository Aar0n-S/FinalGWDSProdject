                <h2>Typography task</h2>
            </section>

            <div class="type-grid-container">
                <div class="type-grid-item-image"> <img class="typography-image" src="images/grid.jpg"> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item-image"> <img class="typography-image" src="images/bilateral.jpg"> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item-image"> <img class="typography-image" src="images/dilational.jpg"> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item-image"> <img class="typography-image" src="images/radial.jpg"> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item"> <p>There are different typographic systems that I have used and designed around for this section. The grid system is made up of horizontal and vertical lines that helps to guide layout choices and encourage consistency. In this design the text is in three columns with patterns in between them to make the design more interesting. The location of the art piece has its own column and is larger to show its importance to the viewer. The design could be improved by reducing some of the white space around the shapes to make that part of the image look less empty. </p> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item"> <p>Bilateral is where the text is arranged along a central axis. This creates a symmetrical and organised design. I curved the text around an oval to add interest and focus the viewers attention from the larger text to the centre with the extra information about the art exhibit. I like the simplicity of this design and its readability. However the center text could be improved by either changing it's shape or splitting parts of it up.</p> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item"> <p>Dialtional uses text along circular paths around a central point. Several larger circles were used to add more depth to the design instead of one ring of text around the singular point. This could be improved by carrying on the spiral theme with the text as well as the shape. This could have made the design seem more cohesive and may have made it more interesting instead of having multiple arcs.</p> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item"> <p>Radial is where all the elements radiate out from a singular point, they all start at one point but don't have to circle around said point like dilational. The text circling around the centre point is repeating the name of the art gallery, then the rest of the information radiates out from it, with the important information highlighted by block colour. The highlighted colours used for the important information is good and makes it easier for the reader, but the text could be made lighter for readability. Also the shapes are random sizes, they could have been made so they form a pattern or are all the same size to look more appealing.</p> </div>
            
            </div>

            <div class="type-grid-container">
                <div class="type-grid-item-image"> <img class="typography-image" src="images/axial.jpg"> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item-image"> <img class="typography-trans-image" src="images/transitional.jpg"> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item-image"> <img class="typography-image" src="images/modular.jpg"> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item-image"> <img class="typography-image" src="images/random.jpg"> </div> 
                <div class="type-grid-item"> <p>Axial is where all the elements are located either side of a single axis. This axis goes from the top left corner to the bottom right. It has some text following it and then some facing away from the axis to draw the user's eye to it. This is good but it could also have a large focus on symmetry, for example some of the text boxes aren't the same size and could be improved by being in the same position and not just on the same angle.</p> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item"> <p>Transitional typography systems are ones that imply movement. For this design I based it on waves and made the text follow the wave pattern along with the border between the dark background at the top and the lighter one at the base. This makes the design form two contrasting halves and draws the viewer's eyes along the movement of the text. The main issue is the slight irregularities with the angels of the text at the top of the page. This could be improved by making it more consistent or making it more irregular.</p> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item"> <p>Modular is a series of non - objective elements. For example the image is based around multiple shapes with the text in front of them. A grid is usually used with this system but doesn't have to be used.</p> </div>
                <div class="type-grid-item"> <p>Random is where the text and elements are placed randomly. The text is different in size and has been stretched. Some of it is also on different angles and follows curved paths. This helps with the random nature of the design but still allows for it to be readable. </p> </div>
