                <h2>Typography task</h2>
            </section>

            <div class="typography-container">

                <div class="row">

                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="typography-image" src="images/grid.jpg">
                        <p>There are different typographic systems that I have used and designed around for this section. The grid system is made up of horizontal and vertical lines that helps to guide layout choices and encourage consistency. In this design the text is in three columns with patterns in between them to make the design more interesting. The location of the art piece has its own column and is larger to show its importance to the viewer. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="typography-image" src="images/bilateral.jpg">
                        <p>Bilateral is where the text is arranged along a central axis. This creates a symmetrical and organised design. I curved the text around an oval to add interest and focus the viewers attention from the larger text to the centre with the extra information about the art exhibit. </p>
                    </div>

                </div>

                <div class="row">

                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="typography-image" src="images/dilational.jpg">
                        <p>Dialtional uses text along circular paths around a central point. Several larger circles were used to add more depth to the design instead of one ring of text around the singular point.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="typography-image" src="images/radial.jpg">
                        <p>Radial is where all the elements radiate out from a singular point, they all start at one point but don't have to circle around said point like dilational. The text circling around the centre point is repeating the name of the art gallery, then the rest of the information radiates out from it, with the important information highlighted by block colour.</p>
                    </div>

                </div>

                <div class="row">

                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="typography-image" src="images/axial.jpg">
                        <p>Axial is where all the elements are located either side of a single axis. This axis goes from the top left corner to the bottom right. It has some text following it and then some facing away from the axis to draw the user's eye to it. </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img class="typography-trans-image" src="images/transitional.jpg">
                        <p>Transitional typography systems are ones that imply movement. For this design I based it on waves and made the text follow the wave pattern along with the border between the dark background at the top and the lighter one at the base. </p>

                        <img class="typography-image" src="images/modular.jpg">
                        <p>Modular is a series of non - objective elements. For example the image is based around multiple shapes with the text in front of them. A grid is usually used with this system but doesn't have to be used.</p>

                        <img class="typography-image" src="images/random.jpg">
                        <p>Random is where the text and elements are placed randomly. The text is different in size and has been stretched. Some of it is also on different angles and follows curved paths. This helps with the random nature of the design but still allows for it to be readable. </p>
