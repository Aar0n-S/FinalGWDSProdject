                <div class="reflection-text"> <p>This module has helped me learn new skills and develop some that I had before. I have used html and CSS before this course but it was only briefly so this helped me develop and expand my knowledge about it and to help improve my design skills.</p> </div>

                <div class="reflection-text"> <p>This course also introduced me to some parts of the adobe suite such as illustrator, indesign, and photoshop. This has shown me new avenues of design such as typography and how that can be used to create more interesting and varied designs.</p> </div>

                <div class="reflection-text"> <p>I have also been introduced to GitHub and how that can improve my workflow by having a central way of backing up code and other files and allowing access to past versions. This helps to organise code and reverse some mistakes if they are made, meaning you don't constantly need to make backups.</p> </div>

                <div class="reflection-text"> <p>This had also helped me learn about file management. For example, when using GitHub, you can’t have folders that are backed up inside another backed up file. In addition, how to manage multiple files and sort them, this was used when doing the worksheets and needing to use different elements and files to complete the task.</p> </div>

                <div class="reflection-text"> <p>When designing the website I hadn't had much experience and had only made a very basic website before so I feel my overall design is quite basic and could be improved to make it look more interesting and give it a more professional look. This could have been achieved by spending more time on the wireframes for the design. However I feel the CARP and typography tasks have gone well as I haven't used the software before and have been newly introduced to those design concepts.</p> </div>

                <div class="reflection-text"> <p>Some parts of the website such as the coding section could be improved due to my lack of knowledge and understanding of how images and styles fully work in HTML and CSS. They could be made better by having all the images for one section aligned to one side and the text to another. However, I couldn’t get this to function fully so a row system was made which doesn’t look as good. Also, some of my wireframes couldn’t be made due to the fact I didn’t know how to properly execute some of the designs with my current skillset and time frame.</p> </div>

                <div class="reflection-text"> <p>However, I feel that I have learn many new skills. These include the use of adobe products and their workflows that I hadn’t previously used and it has helped me to be introduced into graphic design and how to develop different ideas and iterate through them. And I have improved my skills with HTML and CSS even though some parts could be improved.</p> </div>
